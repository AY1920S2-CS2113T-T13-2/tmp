## Overview

**Nuke v2.1** is a simple yet powerful task management application target towards **NUS students**.  **Nuke** aims to provide a more efficient way to organize the user's modules and tasks. The user interacts with **Nuke** using a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI). In its latest versions, it also has a complementary _Graphical User Interface_ version created with JavaFX, though the GUI is still in its _Beta_ stage. **Nuke** is written in Java, and has about 10, 000 lines of code.
